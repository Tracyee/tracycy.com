## Informally

- External choice: you (the _proof term_, or the _program_) are not "part of the choice", instead, you _make_ the choice
  - e.g. "I have $50 birthday gift card and I need to decide between buying a keyboard or a mouse, either way I will be happy!"
- Internal choice: you (the _proof term_, or the _program_) now are "part of the choice", you don’t make the decision, instead, you need to _prepare for_ the decision
  - E.g. "My parents will buy me a gift worth $50, which could be a keyboard or a mouse and I have no control over their decision, but I will be happy regardless!"

## Formally

### Propositions

```sml
H ::= "I am happy"
K ::= "Keyboard"
M ::= "Mouse"
```

### Internal Choice (⊕), left rule

1. To be happy to get `K ⊕ M`, I must be happy to get either one of them.
2. If I were happy to get either one of them, I must be happy to get `K ⊕ M`.

```sml
 Δ, K ⊢ H        Δ, M ⊢ H
--------------------------
      Δ, K ⊕ M ⊢ H
```

> This rule is invertible!

### External Choice (&), left rule

1. If I were happy to get `M`, I must be happy to be able to decide between `K & M`
2. If I were happy to get `K`, I must be happy to be able to decide between `K & M`

```sml
   Δ, M ⊢ H         Δ, K ⊢ H
--------------   --------------
 Δ, K & M ⊢ H     Δ, K & M ⊢ H
```

> These two rules are not invertible!

### Internal Choice (⊕), right rule

1. My parents bought me a `K`, but they can claim they have prepared me with `K ⊕ M`
2. My parents bought me a `M`, but they can claim they have prepared me with `K ⊕ M`

```sml

  Δ ⊢ K        Δ ⊢ M
---------    ----------
Δ ⊢ K ⊕ M    Δ ⊢ K ⊕ M
```

> These two rules are not invertible!

### External Choice (&), right rule

1. To have the ability to decide between a `K & M`, I must have enough money to buy either one of them
2. If I had enough money to buy either one of them, I have the ability to decide between `K & M`

```sml
 Δ ⊢ H   Δ ⊢ K
----------------
   Δ ⊢ K & M
```

> This rule is invertible!
