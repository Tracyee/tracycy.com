**Malloc** is an efficient and fast dynamic memory allocator, which supports
the `malloc`, `free`, `realloc`, and `calloc` operations.

## Target

It is obviously easy to write a fast allocator by just allocating blocks and never freeing them, or a high-utilization allocator that carefully packs blocks as tightly as possible but takes a lot of time doing so. This involves a trade-off. The hard part of the algorithms and data structures is to decently manage free blocks that achieve the right balance of space utilization and speed.

## Features

The memory allocator has following features.

### Data structures and Algorithms

* A hybrid data structure for blocks
    * An implicit linked list
    * A set of segregated free lists, with *mini-block* enabled
* The block structure can be visualized as:
    * Normal free block: `[ HEADER | PRED | SUCC | PAYLOAD | FOOTER ]`
    * Mini free block: `[ HEADER | SUCC ]`
    * Allocated block: `[ HEADER | PAYLOAD ]`

> NOTE: This block structure is kind of a hack and is achieved by using a `union` data type representing either two pointers (free blocks) or the payload (allocated blocks).

* Each of the segregated lists of normal free blocks is a *circular doubly linked list*, while for the mini free blocks there is a *circular singly linked list*.
    * Free List Structure for normal blocks:
    `[Free 1 <==> Free 2 <==> Free 3 <==> ... <==> Free N <==> Free 1]`
    * Free List Structure for mini blocks: `[Free 1 ==> Free 2 ==> Free 3 ==> ... ==> Free N ==> Free 1]`
* It uses *LIFO* for insertion the free list (slightly more efficient than the *FIFO* discipline)
* It uses better fit (first fit + optimizations) to find the appropriate free blocks

The implementation well demonstrates the trade-off between the space utilization and the throughput of the memory allocator. For instance, using *mini-block* can decrease the overall block size and hence increase the utilization by alleviateing the [internal fragmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(computing)#Internal_fragmentation). However, it also slows down the allocator for a bit since it introduces more complicated data structures, and the overall # of searches just rises because of more dedicated blocks.

### Heap Checker

A heap consistency checker is added to check all of the invariants of the data structures, so kind of like a set of tests that run concurrently with the allocator. It runs silently until it detects some error in the heap. Below is a list of the invariants that the heap checker checks.

* Checking the heap (implicit list, segregated list):
    * Check for *epilogue* and *prologue* blocks.
    * Check each block’s *address alignment*.
    * Check blocks lie within *heap boundaries*.
    * Check each block’s *header* and *footer*: size (minimum size), previous/next, allocate/free bit consistency, *header* and *footer* matching each other.
    * Check *coalescing*: no consecutive free blocks in the heap.
* Checking the free list (segregated list):
    * All next/previous pointers are consistent (if $A$’s next pointer points to $B$, $B$’s previous pointer should point to $A$).
    * All free list pointers are between `mem_heap_lo()` and `mem_heap_high()`.
    * Count free blocks by iterating through every block and traversing free list by pointers
    and see if they match.
    * All blocks in each list bucket fall within bucket size range (segregated list).

## Performance

This dynamic memory allocator achieved a throughput of around 8300 kilo-operations per second or KOPS and a utilzation of around 73.5% on a set of trace files each containing a sequence of commands that instruct the driver to call `malloc`, `realloc`, and `free` routines in some sequence.
